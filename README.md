## Data Cleaning and Visualization of the Excavations at Polis Data Set

Within the field of archaeology, excavation is often an integral part of studying a site. However, this process is both costly and time consuming. As a result, 
archaeologists often need to make intelligent decisions on where to excavate to answer a posed research question. Work done here was intended to both facilitate 
these decisions and help with archaeological site analysis. The Excavations at Polis data set from the Open Context data website was cleaned and visualized using MATLAB. 
Many built in tools were used to facilitate data cleaning. However, a new function toCategorize was also written to convert 
text data to categorical data based on the presence of keywords. This function is described in more detail [here](https://github.com/markpanaro/Text-to-Categorical-MATLAB-Function). Tools created enable both sitewide and per context 
analysis. Much of the work done here was later expanded upon using Python within [this](https://github.com/markpanaro/Archaeological-Data-Science-Project) repository.
